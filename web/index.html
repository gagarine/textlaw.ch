                <p><sup><a name="1">1</a></sup>&nbsp;The Federal Constitution of the Swiss Confederation of 29 May
                    1874<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> is repealed.</p>

                <p><sup><a name="2">2</a></sup>&nbsp;The following provisions of the Federal Constitution, which must be
                    re-enacted as statute law, continue to apply until the corresponding statutory provisions come into
                    force:</p>

                <p><em>a. Art. 32</em><em><sup>quater</sup></em> para. 6<sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup></p>

                <p>Hawking and other forms of itinerant sale of spirits are prohibited.</p>

                <p><em>b. Art. 36</em><em><sup>quinquies</sup></em> para. 1 first sentence, 2 second-last sentence and 4
                    second se<em>n</em><em>tence</em><sup><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup></p>

                <p><sup><a name="1">1</a></sup>&nbsp;For the use of first and second class motorways, the Confederation
                    shall levy an annual charge of 40 francs on each Swiss and foreign motor vehicle and trailer with a
                    total weight not exceeding 3.5 tonnes. ...</p>

                <p><sup><a name="2">2</a></sup>&nbsp;... The Federal Council may exempt specific vehicles from the
                    charge and issue special regulations, in particular for journeys made in border areas. Such
                    regulations must not result in vehicles registered abroad being treated more favourably than Swiss
                    vehicles. The Federal Council may impose fines for contraventions of the regulations. The Cantons
                    shall collect the charge for vehicles registered in Switzerland and monitor compliance of all
                    vehicles with the regulations.</p>

                <p><sup><a name="4">4</a></sup>&nbsp;... The charge may be extended by federal act to further categories
                    of vehicle that are not liable to pay the heavy vehicle charge.</p>

                <p><em>c. Art. 121</em><em><sup>bis</sup></em> para. 1, 2 and para. 3 first and second sentence<sup><a

                <p><sup><a name="1">1</a></sup>&nbsp;If the Federal Assembly decides to submit a counter-proposal,
                    voters shall be asked three questions on the same ballot paper. Each voter has the unrestricted
                    right to state:</p>
                <dl compact="compact">
                    <dt>1.</dt>

                    <dt>3.</dt>
                    <dd>which of the two proposals should come into force in the event that the People and the Cantons

                    accepted, the result of the third question shall be decisive. The proposal that receives the greater
                    number of votes from the People and from the Cantons on this question shall come into force. ...</p>

                <p>III</p>

                <p>The Federal Assembly shall adapt amendments to the Federal Constitution of 29&nbsp;May 1874 to the
                    new Federal Constitution as regards their form. The decree issued to this effect shall not be
                    subject to a referendum.</p>

                <p>IV</p>

                <p><sup><a name="1">1</a></sup>&nbsp;This Decree must be submitted to a vote of the People and the
